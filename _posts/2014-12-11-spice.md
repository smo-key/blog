These past few weeks, the group was heavily involved in two common EE programs: SPICE and Logisim.  SPICE is a program used to accurately model a circuit to nearly a per-electron level.  It accurately calculates voltage, propagation delays, and all the information necessary to optimize a circuit.  Logisim is a higher level circuit builder that focuses primarily on boolean logic and circuit manipulation.  While SPICE is an excellent program to determine accurate circuit timing, voltage drops, and temperature control, Logisim should be used to build an accurate *digital* circuit.

## An idea

Well, SPICE is annoying to use, no decent GUI works for Linux, and it doesn't play very nice with the other apps we've been using (e.g. Logisim).  The process so far: Create circuit in SPICE.  Render graphs.  Copy to notebook.  Mess up.  Do it again.  Create *another* (identical) circuit on Logisim.  Don't mess up.  Work, work, work, work. work.  If only there was a program to combine several digital electronics apps into one.

The idea is to create one *open-source* web app (tentatively named ***WebSPICE***) to combine various programs and features in a plug-and-play-sort-of-way.  I would solve the unnecessary banging of heads, the duplication of one circuit in multiple languages, and time.  Therefore, money.
